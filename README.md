## ðŸ”© Hardware
My main motivation when building out my Homelab was to segregate my containers on one device and storage on another. I previously had been running all my apps on my DIY NAS using TrueCharts within TrueNAS Scale. 
### Homelab
My Homelab is run on a Gen 12 Intel NUC maxed out with 64GB of memory.

I'm currently running Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS as I wanted a dependable OS to run headless. 
### Networking
Living in a 950 sqft Loft apartment, I don't have to worry about signal strength. My setup consists of a Google WiFi puck in the Living Room. This is my primary router: one end connects to my in-wall ethernet port and the other end to a Netgear 8-port managed switch. I have an TP-Linke 8-port unmanaged switch plugging into the managed switch in order to expand the number of available ethernet ports.

But you can't have a mesh network with just one puck, so in order to eliminate the potential for any deadzones, I've placed another puck upstairs in the Loft.

I routinely stream games via Moonlight from my desktop computer (in the Office) to the TV (in the Living Room). Initially, I did this over WiFi, but had very little success. Fortunately, there is a coax outlet right under my desk, so using ethernet-over-coax, I am able to hardwire to the network switch in the Living Room.
